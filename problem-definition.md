# Problem Definition

## Problem
RI in hurricanes is an increasingly common and unpre-
dictable phenomenon that is worsened due to rising sea
temperatures from climate change. RI remains very difficult to
forecast in terms of timing and magnitude [5], which can make
proper large-scale preparation difficult. Current physics-based
and numerical weather models struggle to capture subtle inner-
core dynamics in storms [6]. Minor parameterization errors can
result in major changes, which is where we hope a machine
learning model can bridge this gap.
